# Advent of Code - The Polyglot Challenge

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! It's my first year doing it so I decided to add a little bit of extra difficulty by solving each day's puzzle using a different programming language.

## The Challenge Rules

1. Each day must be solved using a different programming language
2. No programming language can be used twice
3. The code should be readable and maintainable

## Progress Tracker

Here's my current progress:

| Day | Language | Status | Notes |
|-----|----------|--------|-------|
| 1   | Kotlin   | âœ…     | First time using Kotlin, was good. |
| 2   | Python   | âœ…     | I hate Python, but everything is so easy |
| 3   | JavaScript | âœ…   | God please kill JavaScript once and for all |
| 4-25| TBD      | ðŸš§     | Languages to be chosen |

â”œâ”€â”€ Day 1/
â”œâ”€â”€ Day 2/
â”œâ”€â”€ Day 3/
â””â”€â”€ README.md

Each day's directory contains:
- Source code in the respective language
- Input data

## Learning Journey 

Just doing it as a way of practicing different concepts and getting to know different languages a bit better.
